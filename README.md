# Azure DevOps Backup

Solution to extract & transport data from Azure DevOps (SaaS)
into external file storage (SharePoint)

Script should run as CronJob with no-concurency policy,
suitable to run in container, requires persistent volume.

Through Azure DevOps REST API application get all Git repos & wikis which are mirrored into file storage.
If there are incremental changes, they are later packed into .zip files and trasported into external storage (SharePoint)

If non-critical error happen, script will keep running but exit code will be 1,
if run is without error exit code is 0

# Requirements

## Linux container with persitent volume

Application is running in container with mounted peristent volume as file storage

## Azure DevOps organization

# Installation

## Requirements

- Docker running Linux containers (for local development)
- Service Principal for Azure Key Vault
- Sharepoint App-Only credentials

## Create configs

### ./configs/test.env

```bash
cat << EOF > ./configs/test.env
DEVOPS_PAT=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION_URL=https://dev.azure.com/organization

SHAREPOINT_URL=https://organization.sharepoint.com/sites/backups
SHAREPOINT_DIR=Documents/DevOps
SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
EOF
```

## Run container

```
docker-compose --env-file ./configs/test.env up --build
```

## Run container inactivelly & attach to it

You will need uncomment following section in <i>docker-compose.yaml</i>

```
    # stdin_open: true
    # tty: true
    # command: tail -f /dev/null
```

and run following command

```
docker-compose --env-file ./configs/test.env up --build -d && docker exec -it git-backup sh
```
